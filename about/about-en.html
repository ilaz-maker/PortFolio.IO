    <h2>Hi! I’m Ilayda</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my little digital world! I’m a curious and creative student who loves technology, storytelling, and turning ideas into real projects.</p>
    <p>If I had to describe myself in three words: curious, passionate, and ambitious. I enjoy exploring new ideas, even the ones that seem a bit crazy at first.</p>
